# data-engineering
This repository contains a collection of data engineering projects demonstrating various concepts, tools, and real-world patterns used in modern data pipelines. Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific area such as ingestion, ETL/ELT, orchestration, data modeling, or cloud engineering.

## 📘 What’s Inside

Each project highlights one or more of the following data engineering skills:
- Data ingestion (APIs, files, databases, streaming sources)
- Data transformation (ETL/ELT with Python, SQL, or Spark)
- Workflow orchestration (Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster)
- Data modeling (Star schema, Data Vault, analytics layers)
- Cloud data engineering (AWS/GCP/Azure pipelines)
- Data quality checks (Great Expectations, custom validations)
- Containerization & deployment (Docker, CI/CD)
- Streaming pipelines (Kafka, Spark Streaming)

 ## 🚀 Getting Started
 ### 1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```
### 2. Navigate to any project
   ```bash
   cd project-1-name
   ```
### 3. Follow that project’s individual README
  Each project includes installation instructions, dependencies, code samples, and usage steps.

### Running Tests
Most projects contain their own test suites.
To run tests for a specific project:
```bash
  cd project-name
  pytest
```
